# Description

This is a template project to create a modularized JavaFX application. It uses Gradle for its build and includes
[The Badass JLink Plugin](https://badass-jlink-plugin.beryx.org/releases/latest/) to create custom runtime images 
and platform specific applications with bundled runtimes with jpackage.

An attempt will be made to keep the repository up-to-date with latest JavaFX and Gradle (and gradle plugin) versions.

## Logging
It includes Logback for logging and it comes with a reasonable default logging configuration that logs to STDOUT and 
to a file at the path `${user.home}/app.log`

An alpha version of Logback 1.3 is used due to some problems with 1.2.11 being used in a modularized
application. See: https://jira.qos.ch/browse/LOGBACK-1380


## Modularization

The application is modularized so that slimmed down runtimes can be bundled with the application
(technically you can do this without modules but it is just easier to keep track of the modules in `module-info.java` 
as you go).

# Using the Project

## Git

1. Clone the project with `git clone https://github.com/mjparme/javafx-template.git` (or fork it and create a clone of your fork)
1. Remove the `.git` directory so it is no longer tied to this repo
1. Execute `git init .` to put it back under version control
1. Push to a remote if you want 

## IntelliJ

IntelliJ will happily configure itself from a Gradle build. 

1. Open IntelliJ
2. File -> Open
3. In the file chooser dialog select the directory that contains the local repository and press the `Open` button. 
IntelliJ will notice the directory has a `build.gradle` in it and then do its thing and in a few minutes you should be good to go.
4. To run it go to `MyApplication.java` and press the green arrow in the gutter next to the class name or 
next to the `main()` method. Or you can open a terminal and execute `./gradlew run`


# Gradle

The project includes the [Gradle Wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) so no local installation of Gradle is needed. 

## Tasks

* `./gradlew run` -- Pretty self explantory, will run the application. 
* `./gradlew jpackage` -- Will package your app with a bundled runtime in a platform specific format. After this runs check the `build/jpacakge` directory for the bundled runtimes. On a Mac this will be a `.dmg`, `.pkg`, and `.app` file. On Windows it will be an `.exe` and `.msi` I think, and a `.rpm` file on linux I think. I have only ever ran this on a Mac so on different platforms just run it and see what you get.
